  "A black hole isn't actually a 'hole'. It's a super-dense region in space with such strong gravity that not even light can escape.",
  "Space is completely silent. There is no atmosphere in space to carry sound, so astronauts need radios to communicate.",
  "Neutron stars are incredibly dense. A single teaspoon of neutron-star material would weigh about 6 billion tons.",
  "The largest volcano in the solar system is on Mars. Olympus Mons is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest!",
  "The Milky Way is on a collision course with Andromeda. In about 4 billion years, the two galaxies will merge to form a new galaxy.",
  "The universe is expanding. The galaxies are moving away from each other, and the further they are, the faster they move apart.",
  "Pluto isnâ€™t technically a planet anymore. In 2006, it was reclassified as a 'dwarf planet' by the International Astronomical Union.",
  "The Hubble Space Telescope has taken over 1.4 million observations of the universe. It has captured some of the most detailed and breathtaking images of space."
